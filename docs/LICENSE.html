<p>Section 2 – Scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>License grant.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and</p></li>
<li><p>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
NonCommercial purposes only.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
its terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
6(a).</p></li>
<li><p>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
(4) never produces Adapted Material.</p></li>
<li><p>Downstream recipients.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every
recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.
Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.</p></li>
<li><p>No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Other rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
Rights, but not otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
purposes.</p></li>

in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and

<li><p>You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.</p></li>

<p>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>

<li><p>for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right

portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
only;</p></li>
<li><p>if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
including for purposes of Section 3(b); and</p></li>
<li><p>You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p></li>

replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT

TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
<li><p>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.</p></li>

<p>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
terminate automatically.</p></li>

Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
violation; or</p></li>
<li><p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
of this Public License.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
will not terminate this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.</p></li>

independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 8 – Interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
be made without permission under this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p></li>
